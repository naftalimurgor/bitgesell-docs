# sendrawtransaction

`sendrawtransaction "hexstring" ( maxfeerate )`

Submit a raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded) to local node and network.

Note that the transaction will be sent unconditionally to all peers, so using this for manual rebroadcast may degrade privacy by leaking the transactionâ€™s origin, as nodes will normally not rebroadcast non-wallet transactions already in their mempool.

Also see createrawtransaction and signrawtransactionwithkey calls.

## Argument #1 - hexstring

**Type:** string, required

The hex string of the raw transaction

## Argument #2 - maxfeerate

**Type:** numeric or string, optional, default=0.10

Reject transactions whose fee rate is higher than the specified value, expressed in BGL/kB.

Set to 0 to accept any fee rate.

## Result

| Name | Type   | Description                 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| hex  | string | The transaction hash in hex |

## Example usage (with RPC call)

Create a transaction:

```sh
BGL-cli createrawtransaction "[{"txid" : "mytxid","vout":0}]" "{"myaddress":0.01}"
```
Sign the transaction, and get back the hex:

```sh
BGL-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet "myhex"
````

Send the transaction (signed hex):

```sh
BGL-cli sendrawtransaction "signedhex"
```

As a JSON-RPC call:

```sh
curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "sendrawtransaction", "params": ["signedhex"]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8334/
```
