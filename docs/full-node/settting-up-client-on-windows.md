# Setting up the client on Windows

Let's set up our client to connect and sync with other nodes

## Sync your the client with other nodes

Once done, Open Bitgesell client and:

1. Create a new wallet: Launch the Bitgesell desktop client and click on "Create New Wallet" to generate a new wallet address. Make sure to backup your wallet seed phrase and keep it in a safe place, as this will be needed to restore your wallet in case of data loss.

2. Sync the blockchain: Once you have created a new wallet, the client will start syncing with the Bitgesell network. This may take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection and the current network congestion.

3. Send and receive transactions: Once your wallet is fully synced, you can start sending and receiving Bitgesell transactions. To send funds, click on the "Send" button and enter the recipient's address and the amount you want to send. To receive funds, share your wallet address with the sender.

4. Secure your wallet: It's important to take measures to secure your wallet, such as setting a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping your seed phrase in a safe place. You may also consider using a hardware wallet for additional security.

5. Stay up to date: Keep your Bitgesell desktop client updated with the latest software releases and security patches to ensure the best user experience and protect your funds from potential security vulnerabilities.

Note: On the Windows platform, remember to white list **`Bitgesell Core`** from Windows Defender or any other anti-virus programs
