Bitgesell Blocksize Explained
===================

## What is Halving?

Halving refers to the process of reducing the rewards for mining cryptocurrency by half after every 210,000 blocks are mined.  Initially, in Bitcoin's early days, miners received 50 BTC per block. However, as mining continued and more bitcoins entered circulation, the reward was halved to 25 BTC after the first 210,000 blocks were mined by 2012.

## How does Bitgesell Halving work?

This mechanism ensures that the increase in currency supply remains controlled, preventing exponential growth, which can lead to upward pressure on its price. For each 210,000 blocks mined, the reward for mining a block decreases by 50%.

Bitgesell halving occours yearly at for each 210,000 blocks mined.
